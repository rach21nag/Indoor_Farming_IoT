# IndoorFarming using IoT

# Introduction

Smart farming has taken a leap from traditional farming as
it brings reliability and predictability at our ngertips. Automation and
cloud software systems are tools for smart farming. Smart farming emphasises
on acquiring data collected by sensors and make productive use
of it. Smart farming employs hardware (IoT) and software (SaaS) to
capture the data and give actionable insights to manage all the operations
on the farm. The data is organized, accessible all the time that can
be monitored remotely and allows us to take necessary actions. Smart
farming analyses soil moisture content, indoor room temperature and
humidity and light intensity to get knowledge about suitable crops and
water requirements for optimization. In this project, dierent sensors are
used to detect real-time physical conditions like temperature, humidity,
light intensity and soil moisture content and send the data to Raspberry
Pi. Then, the data will be processed by Raspberry Pi and uploaded to
the Cloud. Furthermore, the system will automatically maintain ambient
conditions by modulating HVAC devices, indoor lighting and water
pumps to save energy. The web-based application aims to graphically
represent the gathered data to provide better understanding of the facility.
With the help of indoor farming using HVAC and IoT, productivity
and quality of crops are expected to increase signicantly. Additionally,
reduction of carbon footprints is also achieved.
